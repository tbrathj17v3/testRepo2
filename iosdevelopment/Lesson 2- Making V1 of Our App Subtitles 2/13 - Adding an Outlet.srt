All right, so we've added this label on our app, but

0:00:03.780,0:00:05.660
it is currently hidden at all times.

0:00:07.268,0:00:10.300
We want you program our app such that when the user presses on

0:00:10.300,0:00:13.740
the microphone button, we want this label to show up in the correct place.

0:00:15.640,0:00:19.240
To do this we have to create something called an outlet.

0:00:19.240,0:00:24.170
Now, before we understand what outlet means in iOS, I have a question for you.

0:00:24.170,0:00:26.940
What comes to mind when I say the word outlet?
