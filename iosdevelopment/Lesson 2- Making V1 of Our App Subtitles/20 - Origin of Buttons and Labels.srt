All right, before we end this lesson,

0:00:02.270,0:00:08.540
I want to think about where things like buttons and labels are coming from.

0:00:08.540,0:00:13.190
When we make apps for iOS, we can choose from one of many building blocks or

0:00:13.190,0:00:15.720
frameworks that are available to us.

0:00:15.720,0:00:17.690
One of these, is called UI Kit.

0:00:17.690,0:00:18.850
Let me bring it out.

0:00:22.090,0:00:27.640
Now you probably noticed that we imported this framework on the top of our code.

0:00:27.640,0:00:32.229
Inside UIKit, we have classes like UIView.

0:00:32.229,0:00:35.180
This helps us create a rectangular area on the phone,

0:00:35.180,0:00:36.390
where we can create content.

0:00:37.420,0:00:41.580
We also have another class called UIButton, this helps us make a button.

0:00:42.800,0:00:46.400
And finally we have another class called UILabel.

0:00:46.400,0:00:48.660
This helps us create labels.

0:00:48.660,0:00:51.800
There are a few links in the instructor notes that will give you a list of

0:00:51.800,0:00:56.400
all classes inside UIKit and the relationships between those classes.

0:00:56.400,0:01:00.230
This includes a helpful image, that lists out all the classes, and

0:01:00.230,0:01:01.750
how they are connected.

0:01:01.750,0:01:03.570
I encourage you to browse through those links now.
