We just started some constraints to center our button.

0:00:03.850,0:00:07.670
Now imagine you were teaching this idea of constraints to someone.

0:00:07.670,0:00:09.720
How would you go about doing that?

0:00:09.720,0:00:12.190
Is there an analogy you would use?

0:00:12.190,0:00:15.650
The best I can come up with is that constraints are like

0:00:15.650,0:00:18.970
scaffolding that helps hold a building structure in place.

0:00:20.010,0:00:23.420
Although I must admit I am not very happy with this analogy.

0:00:23.420,0:00:25.380
And that is where you can help.

0:00:25.380,0:00:29.350
Think of an analogy that you would use to explain constraints to a friend.
