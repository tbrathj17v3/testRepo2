0:00:00.320,0:00:02.290
We now have a button in our app.

0:00:02.290,0:00:07.150
Although, we want this button to be in the form of, an image of a microphone.

0:00:07.150,0:00:08.200
Let's add that image next.

0:00:09.200,0:00:12.510
So I'll go back to x code and manage some real estate.

0:00:12.510,0:00:18.200
I'll hide the document outline, and slide in the navigator.

0:00:18.200,0:00:20.320
And hide the utility area.

0:00:20.320,0:00:23.280
There, now if you look in the navigator.

0:00:23.280,0:00:26.990
There is this thing called, images.xc assets.

0:00:26.990,0:00:28.930
XC stands for x code.

0:00:28.930,0:00:32.860
And assets means, that this thing is going to help us manage, assets or

0:00:32.860,0:00:34.210
images in our app.

0:00:34.210,0:00:37.690
The first thing to notice here, is something called App Icon.

0:00:37.690,0:00:41.320
This, is the icon that represents our app on the user's phone.

0:00:41.320,0:00:43.190
If you look at the bottom of your screen,

0:00:43.190,0:00:46.680
you'll notice that we can add any new images or assets here.

0:00:46.680,0:00:50.450
I'll click on the plus button, and then on, new image set.

0:00:50.450,0:00:54.060
Let me rename this image set to, microphone.

0:00:54.060,0:00:54.930
There, okay.

0:00:54.930,0:00:58.932
So, here is an image of the microphone on my computer.

0:00:58.932,0:01:03.430
I want to highlight that the size of this image is 100x100 pixels.

0:01:03.430,0:01:07.670
By the way, this image is also available in the instructor notes for you to use.

0:01:07.670,0:01:11.480
Now, you can feel free to use this image or you can customize your app,

0:01:11.480,0:01:15.382
by using your own image or the image of a friend if you like.

0:01:15.382,0:01:19.600
All right, I'm going to drag this image in to the one x box.

0:01:19.600,0:01:20.600
There it is.

0:01:20.600,0:01:23.030
Now, I'm going to start with one x, and

0:01:23.030,0:01:26.670
then I'm going to ask you to guess, what two x and three x mean.

0:01:26.670,0:01:30.802
So, stay sharp and see if you can figure it out from this example.

0:01:30.802,0:01:33.350
All right, so next, I'll go to my story board.

0:01:33.350,0:01:36.500
And here I'll make sure that the record button is selected.

0:01:36.500,0:01:39.470
And then, I will open up the utility area.

0:01:39.470,0:01:41.410
And under the attributes in,

0:01:41.410,0:01:45.700
inspector, I will remove the default text that I had added.

0:01:46.880,0:01:49.310
And then, I will go under images and

0:01:49.310,0:01:52.580
try to find the microphone image that I just added.

0:01:52.580,0:01:53.560
Boom.

0:01:53.560,0:01:55.740
There is my image.

0:01:55.740,0:01:59.710
Now one really curious thing to notice here, is that after I've selected my

0:01:59.710,0:02:05.700
button, if I go to the size inspector, this link right here, I can check out and

0:02:05.700,0:02:09.220
see the width and the height of my button, which is both hundred.

0:02:09.220,0:02:12.170
So that means, that my button has conformed.

0:02:12.170,0:02:14.110
To the size of the image.

0:02:14.110,0:02:19.340
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and run my project, and there it is.

0:02:19.340,0:02:21.990
We've added an image to our button.

0:02:21.990,0:02:24.710
Now, one thing to notice here with this image,

0:02:24.710,0:02:27.980
is that it looks a little bit blurrier around the edges.

0:02:27.980,0:02:30.340
You may have to lean in to see this.

0:02:30.340,0:02:32.990
Or I can actually go to the window menu and

0:02:32.990,0:02:35.536
change the scale of the phone to 100%.

0:02:35.536,0:02:39.760
There, see that the image looks somewhat blurry around the edges?

0:02:39.760,0:02:40.260
Hm.

0:02:40.260,0:02:42.440
Why do you think the image is so blurry?

0:02:42.440,0:02:43.540
Care to venture a guess here?
