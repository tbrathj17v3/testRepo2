0:00:00.420,0:00:02.780
So, here I am in the storyboard, and

0:00:02.780,0:00:06.970
the first thing I want to do is add a button somewhere here in my app.

0:00:06.970,0:00:10.310
The way to do this, is to look in the utility area.

0:00:10.310,0:00:14.010
In here at the bottom, is this button called show the object library.

0:00:14.010,0:00:17.610
I'm going to click on it, and now I have access to a whole bunch of different

0:00:17.610,0:00:23.250
user interface elements, things like a button, a slider, and many others.

0:00:23.250,0:00:26.400
Now, I can look at them, in this list format, or

0:00:26.400,0:00:29.950
I can click on this little button here, and see the icon view.

0:00:29.950,0:00:34.820
There it is, I can even search for things I want like, a button in this case.

0:00:34.820,0:00:36.920
And there's the element I want.

0:00:36.920,0:00:39.990
So I'm going to drag this button, on to the editor.

0:00:39.990,0:00:42.740
And use these blue lines, as a guide for

0:00:42.740,0:00:45.590
dropping it in to the center of the canvas.

0:00:45.590,0:00:50.880
There, I can change the text of this button to let's say, record.

0:00:50.880,0:00:54.050
I can also change the width and the height of this button.

0:00:54.050,0:00:54.770
There.

0:00:54.770,0:00:56.690
Now, one good practice here,

0:00:56.690,0:01:01.560
is to go to the editor menu at the top and click on size to fit content.

0:01:01.560,0:01:05.349
This way the button will automatically change its size, as you type in it.

0:01:07.800,0:01:09.030
There.

0:01:09.030,0:01:10.990
Let me drag this in the center one more time.

0:01:14.150,0:01:16.790
Done. Now, once you've selected the button, I want you to

0:01:16.790,0:01:21.730
click on this tiny little icon here, which is called the Attributes Inspector.

0:01:21.730,0:01:24.700
If you click on it, it will present to you a whole bunch of different options

0:01:24.700,0:01:28.260
that can help you change the, well the attributes of the button.

0:01:28.260,0:01:31.500
You can change the text here, the font here, and

0:01:31.500,0:01:34.962
a whole bunch of different options that we will tinker with soon.

0:01:34.962,0:01:36.650
All right, so for now, what I want to do,

0:01:36.650,0:01:40.880
is I want to run my app and see if this button even shows up on the app.

0:01:40.880,0:01:44.140
The way to do this, is to use something called a simulator,

0:01:44.140,0:01:48.600
which is our way to run the app, without needing a hardware device.

0:01:48.600,0:01:52.460
At the top here, you will notice a list of simulators that are available.

0:01:52.460,0:01:54.710
I'm going to use iPhone 5s and

0:01:54.710,0:01:58.740
that's because, this simulator fits really well on my recording screen.

0:01:58.740,0:02:02.110
You could have used iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 plus for that matter.

0:02:02.110,0:02:05.120
Then I'm going to click on this play button, to run the app.

0:02:05.120,0:02:08.199
Notice that the simulator may take a while to load up.

0:02:08.199,0:02:10.330
When you run it for the first time.

0:02:10.330,0:02:12.720
All right, so there's our simulator.

0:02:12.720,0:02:15.630
And there's the button inside the simulator.

0:02:15.630,0:02:19.450
Although it's not quite in the center yet, and that is somewhat bothersome but

0:02:19.450,0:02:21.350
I will fix that in the next video.

0:02:21.350,0:02:24.430
For now, I can click on it, and nothing happens because we

0:02:24.430,0:02:27.090
haven't programmed the button to do anything just yet.

0:02:27.090,0:02:31.870
As a quick aside, you can do to the window menu here at the top, and change

0:02:31.870,0:02:36.660
the scale, to make sure that the phone fits really well on your computer screen.

0:02:36.660,0:02:38.100
This is a little bit too big for me.

0:02:38.100,0:02:39.970
So, I am going to keep the scale at 50%.

0:02:39.970,0:02:40.470
There.

0:02:41.820,0:02:46.570
Also, if you go to the Hardware menu at the top, you can rotate your phone left.

0:02:46.570,0:02:50.150
You can rotate it right and you can go to the home screen.

0:02:50.150,0:02:50.890
There is our app.

0:02:50.890,0:02:51.560
Pitch perfect.

0:02:52.660,0:02:53.290
All right.

0:02:53.290,0:02:56.320
So, the next thing I am going to do, is I'm going to fix this button, so

0:02:56.320,0:02:57.860
it shows up in the center of the phone.
