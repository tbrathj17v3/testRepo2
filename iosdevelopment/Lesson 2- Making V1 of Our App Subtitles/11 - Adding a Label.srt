0:00:00.280,0:00:03.090
So the next thing I want to do is I want to show some

0:00:03.090,0:00:06.120
text reading recording in progress.

0:00:06.120,0:00:08.980
And I want this text to show up right here,

0:00:08.980,0:00:11.220
right underneath the microphone button.

0:00:11.220,0:00:14.330
To do this, I will go back to the standard editor.

0:00:14.330,0:00:19.370
There I see my storyboard and then I will slide out the utility area.

0:00:19.370,0:00:23.382
Let me center my storyboard.

0:00:23.382,0:00:24.840
There.

0:00:24.840,0:00:28.420
Now in here, I'm looking for something called a label.

0:00:28.420,0:00:32.430
Let me actually go back to the list view to see what it does.

0:00:32.430,0:00:33.240
There it is.

0:00:33.240,0:00:37.370
It says, A label is a variable sized amount of static text,

0:00:37.370,0:00:39.240
which is exactly what we need.

0:00:39.240,0:00:44.000
I'm going to drag this label and place it right underneath my microphone button.

0:00:44.000,0:00:44.910
There.

0:00:44.910,0:00:50.610
Let me change its text to recording and then reposition it.

0:00:52.260,0:00:53.550
There.

0:00:53.550,0:00:58.120
Now, while the label is selected, I will go to the Attributes Inspector, and

0:00:58.120,0:01:00.670
then begin to change a whole bunch of things about this label.

0:01:00.670,0:01:02.170
For instance, I can change its font.

0:01:03.360,0:01:04.530
I can pick a custom font.

0:01:06.250,0:01:07.360
This is the font I like.

0:01:08.520,0:01:13.850
I can reduce the font size, can make the label central lined.

0:01:15.960,0:01:17.246
I can also change its color.

0:01:24.303,0:01:26.163
And I will also go to the Editor and

0:01:26.163,0:01:29.230
make sure that I select the Size to Fit Content option.

0:01:31.780,0:01:34.770
Let me reposition this one more time so it's right underneath the button.

0:01:36.170,0:01:36.670
There.

0:01:37.690,0:01:40.150
All right, I'm going to go ahead and run this and see how it looks.

0:01:41.170,0:01:44.110
All right, we can see our label right here,

0:01:44.110,0:01:47.420
although there seem to be a couple of things that are odd with it.

0:01:47.420,0:01:49.820
One is that it is not properly aligned.

0:01:49.820,0:01:52.750
It's not lined up right underneath the microphone button.

0:01:52.750,0:01:55.430
Now, this happened with this microphone button also, so

0:01:55.430,0:01:58.300
we kind of know a way to fix this.

0:01:58.300,0:02:01.250
And the other thing that's weird is that this label or

0:02:01.250,0:02:03.570
text is showing up by default.

0:02:03.570,0:02:05.440
The correct behavior would be for

0:02:05.440,0:02:09.080
this label to show up after we have pressed the microphone button.

0:02:09.080,0:02:10.940
How would you fix these issues?

0:02:10.940,0:02:14.520
Here are the two things you would want to fix with this label one more time.

0:02:14.520,0:02:15.980
My recommendation is that you search for

0:02:15.980,0:02:20.130
documentation and then post your responses on the discussion forum.

0:02:20.130,0:02:22.520
Once you're done, select one of these two options.
