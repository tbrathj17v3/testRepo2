0:00:00.450,0:00:04.300
So it seems that the recording label needs to be somewhere here on

0:00:04.300,0:00:09.920
the screen, which means that it needs to be centered horizontally and

0:00:09.920,0:00:12.660
a fixed distance away from the microphone button.

0:00:12.660,0:00:14.690
Let's add these constraints to the label next.

0:00:16.170,0:00:19.930
So what I'm going to do is hold down the Control key on my keyboard,

0:00:19.930,0:00:22.660
click on the label, and then drag.

0:00:22.660,0:00:25.510
And when I let go, I am presented with this dialogue.

0:00:25.510,0:00:29.299
And I will select the Center Horizontally option here,

0:00:29.299,0:00:32.207
which will center my label horizontally.

0:00:32.207,0:00:36.440
And then I will hold down the Control key one more time, click on the label, and

0:00:36.440,0:00:40.739
then drag towards the microphone button, and then create a vertical spacing in

0:00:40.739,0:00:44.480
between the button, the microphone button that is, and the label.

0:00:45.710,0:00:46.660
There.

0:00:46.660,0:00:49.070
Now at this point, if I open the document outline,

0:00:50.860,0:00:54.180
I can see that I added a couple of new constraints here.

0:00:54.180,0:00:57.320
There's the constraint for the vertical space between the microphone button and

0:00:57.320,0:01:01.330
the label, and there is the horizontal alignment for the label.

0:01:01.330,0:01:02.020
Okay.

0:01:02.020,0:01:05.930
Let me go ahead and close the document outline and run this project again.

0:01:08.370,0:01:09.190
Aha.

0:01:09.190,0:01:12.110
The label is showing up in the correct location.

0:01:12.110,0:01:17.500
Although this label is showing up by default, the correct behavior would be for

0:01:17.500,0:01:21.210
this label to be hidden when the app first launches.

0:01:21.210,0:01:26.020
So to fix this, I will go back to Xcode, select my label, and under

0:01:26.020,0:01:31.650
Attributes Inspector, I will scroll down to find this option called Hidden.

0:01:31.650,0:01:35.300
This will make sure that my label is hidden by default.

0:01:35.300,0:01:39.180
You can actually see a faint representation of it on the storyboard.

0:01:39.180,0:01:40.480
Let me run this app one more time.

0:01:42.540,0:01:45.260
All right, the label does not show up by default.
