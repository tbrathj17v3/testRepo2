That previous video, was really long.

0:00:03.110,0:00:06.610
Before we continue, I want to share with you this one question a lot of

0:00:06.610,0:00:11.130
students ask me, when I teach them programming, and that question is,

0:00:11.130,0:00:13.180
how did I learn all of this stuff?

0:00:13.180,0:00:18.280
Well, the true answer is, I searched for and read documentation.

0:00:18.280,0:00:21.870
I Googled for how to create an action, in Xcode.

0:00:23.360,0:00:27.090
And here, I landed on a help page created by Apple.

0:00:27.090,0:00:31.730
This page demonstrated how to make a connection between a button, and code.

0:00:31.730,0:00:36.100
So it is in this spirit of figuring out new things while reading documentation,

0:00:36.100,0:00:37.970
I want to present a couple of challenges to you,

0:00:37.970,0:00:40.540
that you can help find the answers for.

0:00:40.540,0:00:42.040
Your first question.

0:00:42.040,0:00:44.380
What does this tiny circle do?

0:00:44.380,0:00:45.910
You can find the circle.

0:00:45.910,0:00:48.520
Right next to the action, in the gutter.

0:00:48.520,0:00:52.000
And your second question, is what does this tiny icon do?

0:00:52.000,0:00:54.320
This icon is called Connections Inspector.

0:00:54.320,0:00:56.770
And you can find it in the Utility area.

0:00:56.770,0:00:58.860
You can enter your responses, in these boxes.
