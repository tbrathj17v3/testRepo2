So here is a giant model of our phone, and

0:00:03.440,0:00:06.420
our button is placed somewhere over here.

0:00:06.420,0:00:07.570
What we really want to do

0:00:09.480,0:00:13.560
is center line this button both vertically and horizontally.

0:00:13.560,0:00:17.590
Now, the way to figure out how to do this is by reading documentation.

0:00:17.590,0:00:19.840
So here is your opportunity to practice.

0:00:19.840,0:00:22.690
How would you go about making sure this button

0:00:22.690,0:00:24.950
is centered vertically and horizontally?

0:00:24.950,0:00:26.850
See if you can figure it out.
