The reason why this image is blurry,

0:00:02.930,0:00:09.090
is because we are simulating our app on iPhone 5S, which has a retina display.

0:00:09.090,0:00:13.070
Retina display means more pixels and therefore more quality.

0:00:13.070,0:00:15.960
So what the simulator is looking for, is a 2x image.

0:00:16.990,0:00:17.660
It's looking for

0:00:17.660,0:00:23.190
this image right here, which by the way is just two times the size of the 1x.

0:00:23.190,0:00:25.838
And here I have the same microphone image,

0:00:25.838,0:00:29.980
except that its size is 200 by 200 pixels.

0:00:29.980,0:00:32.930
This is twice as big as the previous image we used.

0:00:32.930,0:00:36.720
By the way, this image is also available in the instructor notes.

0:00:36.720,0:00:41.110
So what I'm going to do is drag this image into the 2x.

0:00:41.110,0:00:42.190
There.

0:00:42.190,0:00:47.210
All right. I'll go back to Xcode and then stop the project and run it again.

0:00:47.210,0:00:50.520
Aha, the image isn't blurry anymore.

0:00:50.520,0:00:53.960
By the way, this form of attention to design detail

0:00:53.960,0:00:58.140
is extremely important when building apps for the Apple ecosystem.

0:00:58.140,0:01:01.090
And because it's so important, let's dive a little bit deeper into

0:01:01.090,0:01:03.000
seeing what's actually going on here behind the scenes.

0:01:03.000,0:01:06.060
The thing to understand here is that

0:01:06.060,0:01:09.810
the 1x scale factor works with non-retina phones.

0:01:09.810,0:01:12.942
And these were used in old iPhones, like the iPhone 3G.

0:01:12.942,0:01:17.380
The 2x scale factor, however, has a retina screen, and

0:01:17.380,0:01:20.640
this is used in phones like the iPhone 4 and 5s.

0:01:20.640,0:01:25.640
A phone that uses the retina screen in this case means double the number of

0:01:25.640,0:01:28.680
pixels as compared to a non retina screen.

0:01:28.680,0:01:32.910
And that is what produces a much better quality for these phones.

0:01:32.910,0:01:37.600
So when we use an image from 1x in a phone like iPhone 5s,

0:01:37.600,0:01:43.310
the image looks somewhat blurry as this phone is expecting a 2x image.

0:01:43.310,0:01:47.040
Now you can imagine that the 3x scale factor is used for

0:01:47.040,0:01:51.498
newer phones, phones like the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus.

0:01:51.498,0:01:53.170
If you want to learn more about this,

0:01:53.170,0:01:55.860
we've added a couple of helpful links in the instructor notes.
