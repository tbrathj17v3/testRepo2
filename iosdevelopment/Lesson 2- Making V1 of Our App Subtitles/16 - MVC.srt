0:00:00.710,0:00:03.960
At this point, I want to pause and connect the code that

0:00:03.960,0:00:08.400
we've written thus far to an image we saw previously in the course.

0:00:08.400,0:00:13.350
Here we tried to divide the different parts of our app into three camps.

0:00:13.350,0:00:15.200
I also want to investigate our code and

0:00:15.200,0:00:19.860
find out why is this programming file called ViewController?

0:00:19.860,0:00:22.880
What do those words view and controller even mean?

0:00:22.880,0:00:25.793
The place where this conversation starts is with an acronym.

0:00:25.793,0:00:30.800
MVC, or model, view, and controller.

0:00:30.800,0:00:32.950
And what this is, is a way to design or

0:00:32.950,0:00:36.280
make software applications like the app that we are making.

0:00:36.280,0:00:37.650
Let's begin with what is a view?

0:00:38.700,0:00:41.390
Simply put, a view is what the user sees or

0:00:41.390,0:00:43.560
is what is really visual on the screen.

0:00:43.560,0:00:47.330
So in our case, that would be buttons like the microphone button and

0:00:47.330,0:00:50.060
labels like the recording in progress label.

0:00:50.060,0:00:54.360
If you look at the document outline, you will notice that the microphone button,

0:00:54.360,0:00:56.180
the recording in progress label,

0:00:56.180,0:00:59.140
the stop button, they all form a part of our view.

0:01:00.240,0:01:04.410
To highlight the view on our screen, I can change its background color.

0:01:04.410,0:01:08.400
I can simply slide out the utility area and change the background color.

0:01:08.400,0:01:08.970
Boom.

0:01:08.970,0:01:09.470
Done.

0:01:11.170,0:01:13.890
Then let's think about the model.

0:01:13.890,0:01:16.280
This refers to the data of our app.

0:01:16.280,0:01:20.120
Now, we do not have one explicitly defined just yet.

0:01:20.120,0:01:24.660
But when we record our audio in lesson four, that audio file, including the name

0:01:24.660,0:01:28.690
of the file, the date it was recorded, that will all become a part of our model.

0:01:29.750,0:01:32.890
And finally let's talk about the controller.

0:01:32.890,0:01:34.960
A controller, as its name suggests,

0:01:34.960,0:01:39.370
controls conversations between the model and the view.

0:01:39.370,0:01:42.960
In our case, that is the ViewController.swift file.

0:01:42.960,0:01:46.650
When a user presses on a button, like the microphone button,

0:01:46.650,0:01:49.840
the controller handles that using an action.

0:01:49.840,0:01:54.020
Also, when a controller wants to change something in a view, like show and

0:01:54.020,0:01:57.550
hide this recording in progress label, it uses an outlet.

0:01:58.620,0:02:03.540
Now, a valid question to ask at this point is, why do all of this?

0:02:03.540,0:02:06.440
Well, the most important advantage is that we

0:02:06.440,0:02:09.560
can separate the major components of our app.

0:02:09.560,0:02:11.910
This helps in building large apps and

0:02:11.910,0:02:13.810
in making changes to them at a later stage.
