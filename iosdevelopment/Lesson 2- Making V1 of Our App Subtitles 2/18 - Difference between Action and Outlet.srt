Here is your second question.

0:00:02.358,0:00:05.730
We've seen, two different types of connections we can make in X code.

0:00:05.730,0:00:09.210
One is called an action, and the other one is called an outlet.

0:00:09.210,0:00:11.580
I want you to think about the difference between an action and

0:00:11.580,0:00:13.780
outlet, and write down your explanations here.
